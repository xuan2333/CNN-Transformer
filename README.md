# CNN-Transformer



# introduction
CNN-Transformer is a hybrid deep learning method based on CNN and Transformer, used to predict orphan genes of moso bamboo.It is implemented by pytorch and all main scripts are written by Python on PC under a Microsoft Windows 10 operating system.

# Dependency
windows operating system

python 3.8.2

Pytorch

# Datasets.zip
"Phyllostachys_edulis_V1.pep" is all the moso bamboo protein data downloaded on the Bamboo GDB official website.
"train.csv" is the training set
"valid.csv" is the validation set
"test.csv" is the test set
"maozhu_protein.csv"is a csv file of all protein data of moso bamboo.
